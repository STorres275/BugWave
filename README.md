# BugWave
Obstacle avoiding game developed in Java during the <A/C> Bootcamp "GamesWeek".
This project was developed by a team of 6 in post-work hours during the span of a week. It allowed us to apply our knowledge of java and OOP that we had been taught so far.

## Description
Oh no! As he was developing his first app, the code cadet (you!) came across his first bugs! Do you think you can help him avoid the bugs and finish his app on his journey to become a master coder?

Objective: Move across the map without letting the bugs get hold of you. Remember, you only have 4 tries before they overwhelm you. 

## Controls 
Use the arrow keys to move the player across the map. 

## Installation
You need to have the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed in your PC. In case you don´t have it, you can download the latest Oracle JDK [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).

If you already have it, just run the BugWave.jar file located in the main folder.

## Acknowledgments 
I want to thank all the team members for having contributed not only with technical knowledge, but also with a spirit that made the development of this game immensely fun.

## Project Status
Firstly we wanted to make the game a little bit more complex with pick-up items and more levels, but the deadline didn´t allow us. Having said that, the game is considered finished, but with room for improvement.
